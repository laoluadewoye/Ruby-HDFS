Sending file flow CRUD

1) Interface sends Create Request to Name
	- Create contains file name and other information about the file.
2) Name reads request and sends back Create Response
	- Contains Session ID for sending data along with Create Request checksum.
3) Interface sends stream of File Chunks (SendFileChunk) with both the session id and checksum
4) Name reassembles the stream at the end


File data vs Block data

Block level data
- Block ID
